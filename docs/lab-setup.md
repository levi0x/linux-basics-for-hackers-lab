# Ethics & Scope

This repository documents my learning from *Linux Basics for Hackers* and related labs.

## Scope
- Practice is limited to my own devices, VMs, and explicitly authorized labs (e.g., TryHackMe/HTB if used).
- No unauthorized access, scanning, exploitation, or “testing” of systems I do not own or have written permission to test.

## Goal
Build strong Linux fundamentals for defensive security, troubleshooting, and automation.
