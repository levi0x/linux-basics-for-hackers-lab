# linux-basics-for-hackers-lab

Hands-on notes and labeled screenshots from my study of *Linux Basics for Hackers* (Linux fundamentals, networking, and security basics).

## Goals
- Build strong Linux fundamentals for cybersecurity and IT troubleshooting
- Practice commands in a safe lab environment and document everything clearly
- Grow into basic scripting/automation with Bash + Python

## Repository layout
- `docs/` → notes, lab setup, and ethics/scope
- `screenshots/` → chapter-organized screenshots of commands and exercises
- `scripts/` → future automation (bash/python)

## Current progress
- Chapters: 1–3 (in progress / review)
- Focus: filesystem basics, text manipulation, and basic networking commands

## Quick links
- Lab setup: `docs/lab-setup.md`
- Notes (Ch 1–3): `docs/linux-notes-ch1-3.md`
- Ethics & scope: `docs/ethics-scope.md`

## Lab environment
- OS: Kali Linux
- Tools: terminal, basic Linux utilities, (add more as you go)

## How I’m using this repo
I’m treating this as a learning log + portfolio to demonstrate consistent hands-on practice.

Performed only in a local lab/VM network on systems I own or have explicit permission to test. No real-world targets.
