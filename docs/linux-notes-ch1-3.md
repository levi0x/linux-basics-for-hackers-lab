# Linux Practice — Chapters 1–3 (Homelab)

## Environment (Ethical Lab Scope)
- Host: macOS (MacBook Pro)
- VirtualBox VMs: Ubuntu + Kali Linux
- Scope: authorized homelab only (no unauthorized scanning or access)

---

## Chapter 1 — Linux + Text Basics
I practiced:
- Navigating the filesystem (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`)
- Reading large files safely (`head`, `tail`, `more`, `less`)
- Searching text + using pipes (`grep`, `cat | grep`)
- Adding line numbers (`nl`)

Evidence:
- See `screenshots/ch1/`

---

## Chapter 2 — Core System Skills
I practiced:
- (Add your actual Chapter 2 topics here — ex: permissions, ownership, processes)

Evidence:
- See `screenshots/ch2/`

---

## Chapter 3 — Networking Fundamentals
I practiced:
- Network interfaces + IP info (`ip a`, `ip link`)
- DNS + connectivity checks
- Managing network settings in a lab (ex: `nmcli`)
- Routes and troubleshooting basics

Evidence:
- See `screenshots/ch3/`

## Why this matters (Blue Team / DFIR)
These skills support:
- log review + triage
- known-good system changes (permissions/process awareness)
- network visibility (interfaces/routes/DNS)
- building automation later with Python
